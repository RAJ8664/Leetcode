<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game">174. Dungeon Game</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><p>The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in <strong>the bottom-right corner</strong> of a <code>dungeon</code>. The <code>dungeon</code> consists of <code>m x n</code> rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in <strong>the top-left room</strong> and must fight his way through <code>dungeon</code> to rescue the princess.</p>

<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to <code>0</code> or below, he dies immediately.</p>

<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&#39;s health (represented by positive integers).</p>

<p>To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only <strong>rightward</strong> or <strong>downward</strong> in each step.</p>

<p>Return <em>the knight&#39;s minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> dungeon = [[-2,-3,3],[-5,-10,1],[10,30,-5]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path: RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN.

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> dungeon = [[0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == dungeon.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == dungeon[i].length</code></li>

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    private int dp[][];
    public int calculateMinimumHP(int[][] arr) {
        int n = arr.length, m = arr[0].length;
        dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];
        for (int current[] : dp) 
            Arrays.fill(current, (int)(1e9));
        dp[n][m - 1] = 1;
        dp[n - 1][m] = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                int current = Math.min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]) - arr[i][j];
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(1, current);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```
